This is the first Odin Project`s real project. 
I need to create a replica of Google`s home page.
Using just plain HMTL and CSS. 
The project will not make any exterior connection (for instance, using links) for the main goal is the visual (CSS) and the placement of the element (HTML and CSS).
Trying to practice some things, I used mediaqueries to make the site more responsive. 
As I don`t know javascrit and any other programming language yet. I made the effect in the I am Feeling Lucky button using only CSS.
